# Software Technology Experiment 1
## Technical problems
* ### Installation of Maven software management tool inside VSC
    The first and only time consuming problem I encountered was in the initial setup of JAVA and Maven. 
    I usually use VSC as IDE and tried starting a java maven project through supported tools there but ended up with an error code when trying to create a new project.
    After editing a bit in the sysenv and restarting the IDE it eventually worked.
    
* ### Heroku platform
    There were only one issue with following the heroku tutorial. When trying to run "mvn" command, it was not recognized. Probably because I never 
    properly installed maven tools. This was solved by running the "mvnw" command instead.


## Validation
To validate that the enviornment was working I compared to the tutorial and also changed some variables to see if changes were taking place.
