# Software Technology Experiment 2
### Technical difficulties
#### Installation of JPA and other software
I encountered multiple issues in installing JPA and its components. More specifically there were some issues with setting the path variables and also getting the correct JDK version to match the downloaded project. After some google searching most of the issues were solved. There were also some issues with getting derby to work as I missed out the part of having to create a new path for the database. Lombok also didn't work in the beginning. After hours of troubleshooting, the issue seemed to be connected to the IDE that I used, VScode. After installing an extention, everything worked fine.
#### Experiment 1
First part of the experiment went fine, and I did manage to inspect the database with the file downloaded from dat250public repo. See picture below. But after countless of hours trying to get the de.vogella.jpa.eclipselink project to work, I gave up. I did not manage to run the program. I believe I was close and that the error was related to the placement of some files. Link to the changes I did is found further down.

## How I inspected the database
To inspect the database, IJ tools was used. This was rather simple to get working. Following images shows the code used for this.
